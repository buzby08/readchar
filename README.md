# readchar

*readchar* is a cross-platform c++ library designed to allow detection of 
keypresses in c++.

This is a direct copy of the python readchar module, written and compiled in c++, to allow developers
to easily get key presses. 

This project is inspired by readchar by Miguel Angel Garcia, licensed under the MIT Licence

On windows, this uses one dependency: utf8cpp. The code for this is already included, so you do not need to install anything. But windows is being windows, and likes to be stupid.

Side note. This has been build and tested on Linux. It should work on windows, but this hasn't been tested, nor has it been compiled. I would appreciate if someone could help with this. Contact me for help.
