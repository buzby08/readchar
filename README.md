# readchar

*readchar* is a cross-platform c++ library designed to allow detection of 
keypresses in c++.

This is a direct copy of the python readchar module, written and compiled in c++, to allow developers
to easily get key presses. 

This project is inspired by readchar by Miguel Angel Garcia, licensed under the MIT Licence
